# Coding Challenge - project name: mediameta

* Implement and test a working RESTful API to create, retrieve, update and delete metadata for Feature, TV and Bonus content.
* For the retrieve operation, include capabilities to filter by Title Type (Bonus, Episode, Season, TV Series, and Feature).

## Overview  

I configured the API on swaggerhub.  After the REST Api was ready, created Java code stubs and modified to address the requirements. 

project *mediameta* is available at: (https://github.com/frankboller/watcher/tree/master/codingChallenge)
* mediameta.json (https://github.com/frankboller/watcher/blob/master/codingChallenge/mediameta/mediameta.json) was uploaded to the swagger editor and converted to YAML
* YAML file is as shown in editor at this URL: (https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/frankboller/mediameta_api/1.0.0#/)
    * NOTE: this link is only visable to those registered at swaggerhub.  Thankfully it is free.
* Initial Java server code was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
* This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

*NOTE:* this is not a full implementation with persistance,  just enough to demo

The project can be built as follows 
* git clone https://github.com/frankboller/watcher.git
* cd watcher/codingChallenge/mediameta
* mvn clean package
* ./debug.sh
    * this is a simple script which sets up IDE debug arguments for Java8
    * it essentially is: java ${args} -jar target/swagger-spring-1.0.0.1.jar
* without debug, it can be run with: java -jar target/swagger-spring-1.0.0.1.jar
    * logging is sent to stdout
* run the local app in a browser: http://localhost:8080/mediameta/
* the api page will be shown
    * ![mediameta.1.png](/images/mediameta.1.png "mediameta.1.png")
    * click on the "users" link 
        * or: http://localhost:8080/mediameta/swagger-ui.html#!/users
    * click on the "GET" button
        * or: http://localhost:8080/mediameta/swagger-ui.html#!/users/searchTitleItem
    * some example value for the model will be shown
        * for the first pass, do not enter "type" or "searchString", just click "Try it out!" button.
    * ![mediameta.no.filter.png*](/images/mediameta.no.filter.png* "mediameta.no.filter.png*")
    * check the console to see the java model toString() output
    * the "curl" output is also shown
        * curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8080/mediameta/title'
        * try this in a new console
* for the next pass,  enter into the "type" widgit:  feature
    * click "Try it out!" button.
        * as shown the curl is now
            * curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8080/mediameta/title?type=feature'
        * try this in a new console
* for the next pass,  enter into the "type" widgit:  tvseries

## Philosophy / Development Methodology

#### agile [(toc)](#toc)
time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery:
[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

* We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.

* starting new projects
![newProjectMup.png](/images/startNewProject.png "startNewProject.png")

* [Test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development): relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.
![devMethodology.png](/images/devMethodology.png "development methodology")

* [Behavior-driven development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development): n software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development process that emerged from test-driven development (TDD)

* [tdd vs bdd](https://codeutopia.net/blog/2015/03/01/unit-testing-tdd-and-bdd/): BDD can, and should be, used together with TDD and unit testing methods

#### kanban vs. scrum [(toc)](#toc)
The question of which work method(s) works best isnít easy
* [What are the differences?](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum/): Which agile software development methodology is better suited...

    concern                        | kanban                                           | scrum
    ---                            | ---                                              | ---
    roles & responsibilities       | no pre-defined roles for a team                  | predefined roles
    due dates / delivery timelines | continious delivery                              | sprints define deliverables
    delegation & prioritization    | team members pull tasks                          | entire batch pulled each iteration
    modifications / changes        | changes can be made mid-stream                   | changes mid-sprint discouraged
    measurement of productivity    | cycle time                                       | velocity through sprints
    best applications              | best for projects with widely-varying priorities | best for teams with stable priorities

#### user story vs job story [(toc)](#toc)
Too many assumptions are dangerous

[Designing features using Job Stories](https://blog.intercom.com/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/): Personas and User Stories made sense when customers and product teams were far from each other. Thatís no longer the case

* Traditionally, who the customer was and what they needed fell within the responsibility of marketing, business development, or even sales. After this information was gathered, it would be synthesized into a portable format and then pitched over the fence to a product development team, who was responsible for building the product

[Replacing The User Story With The Job Story](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27):

* We frame every design problem in a Job, focusing on the triggering event or situation, the motivation and goal, and the intended outcome:
When ... , I want to ... , so I can ... .

integration and functional testing platform:
[Dan Allen on Arquillian Testing Framework](https://www.infoq.com/articles/dan-allen-arquillian-framework)

also:
[Arquillian ¬∑ Write Real Tests](http://arquillian.org/)

* So you can rule your code. Not the bugs.  No more mocks. No more container lifecycle and deployment hassles. Just real tests!

also:
[BDD Behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)

* In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development process that emerged from test-driven development (TDD). ... The tools serve to add automation to the ubiquitous language that is a central theme of BDD.

#### devops [(toc)](#toc)
set of practices:
(DevOps - Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps]

* DevOps (a clipped compound of "software DEVelopment" and "information technology OPerationS") is a term used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.

#### docker [(toc)](#toc)
open platform for developers and sysadmins:
[Docker - Build, Ship, and Run Any App, Anywhere](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

* Docker is the world‚Äôs leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù problems when collaborating on code with co-workers.

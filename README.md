## Welcome to Watcher

This is a place for spectators

* it is a simple project intended to showcase technology implementation samples, implementations, bugs, links and documentation

### Philosopy, Code Tools, Frameworks, Artifacts and Plugins

#### Agile
time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery philosopy:
[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

* We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value: 

#### maven
project management:
[Code Tools: maven](https://maven.apache.org/)  

* Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

#### jmh
test harness:
[Code Tools: jmh](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) 

* JMH is a Java harness for building, running, and analysing nano/micro/milli/macro benchmarks written in Java and other languages targetting the JVM.

also:
[Java Performance Tuning Guide](http://java-performance.info/jmh/)

* various tips on improving performance of your Java code

#### DevOps
set of practices:
(DevOps - Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps]

* DevOps (a clipped compound of "software DEVelopment" and "information technology OPerationS") is a term used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.

#### Docker
open platform for developers and sysadmins:
[Docker - Build, Ship, and Run Any App, Anywhere](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

* Docker is the worldâ€™s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate "works on my machine" problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps.

#### Fabric8
end to end development platform:
[fabric8: open source Integrated Development Platform for Kubernetes](https://fabric8.io/)

#### Vagrant
open-source software product:
[Introduction to Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/index.html)

* Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

#### Polymer
library for creating Web Components:
[Welcome - Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

* Unlock the Power of Web Components. Polymer is a JavaScript library that helps you create custom reusable HTML elements, and use them to build performant, maintainable apps.

also:
[Here's the difference between Polymer and Angular](http://www.binpress.com/blog/2014/06/26/polymer-vs-angular/)

* Angular is a complete framework for building webapps, whereas Polymer is a library for creating Web Components. Those components, however, can then be used to build a webapp. Angular has high-level APIs for things like services, routing, server communication and the like.
